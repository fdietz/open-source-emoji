Open source Emoji plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin uses open source Emoji so it's fully legal to use without breaching copyright of Emoji artworks. 

Choose between the Android style and the full colour [Phantom](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/374397522/phantom-open-emoji) set.

All Emoji on your pages are converted to visible icons, not just the ones you add in your posts.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip all files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Log into Wordpress admin and activate the 'Open Source Emoji' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Go to *Settings > OS Emoji* to change the Emoji icon styles.

= Adding Emoji to your posts =

To enter Emoji into your posts, use the [emoji ..] shortcode with the name of the Emoji following it. e.g. `[emoji cat face]`.

See the [full list of supported Emoji codes](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode). Enter the description that appears in the right hand column.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are the Emoji icons copyright? =

No. This plugin uses only open source licensed artworks. See the Credits tab.

= Why are some icons missing? =

The Android Emoji set is [missing some characters](http://timwhitlock.info/blog/2013/04/androids-missing-emoji/) that you'll find on other systems, but it does follow the published Unicode standard.

The Phantom Emoji set is very new and the team are still adding new icons. Keep this plugin updated to get the new icons as they're created.

=  Why do the icons appear the wrong size compared to my text? =

The Phantom Emoji set uses fixed size images at 22px.  I'm working on making them scalable.

The Android Emoji is scalable because it's a font. If the fixed size Emoji don't work for you, consider using that.


= Are these FAQs complete? =

No. I'm working on them. Feel free to ask a question in the Support tab, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/timwhitlock)
